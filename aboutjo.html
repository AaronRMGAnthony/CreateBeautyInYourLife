                <h2>About Jo</h2>
                <p>Jo initially began her career as a professional dancer, singer, and actress, receiving her training at Guildford School of Acting and Dance in the UK. She worked professionally in theatre on the West End of London, throughout the UK and abroad. When Jo moved to the U.S, she knew her calling was to help people in need. So, for the past 30 years, she has been serving as a personal trainer to rehabilitate the injured, and to teach others to condition the body.</p>
                <p>Today, she is not only helping others to heal and become strong during her training sessions, but she is bringing peace to their homes by creating an enjoyable environment &mdash; tailored to your preferences.</p>
                <p>Recently, Jo has settled into her new home &mdash; completely transforming the place, inside and out! Outside, she has constructed two cozy, heated, mini-home sheds (one is for art, both are for lounging); abundantly-producing gardens; and an outdoor living space with a projector for entertainment. Inside, she has applied her signature peaceful style that feels like home.</p>
